# Tic_Tac_Toe
Tic Tac Toe is the classic game developed using React and tutorials from my coursework in MIT. Two players take turns using an X and an O to fill up a grid game board and get three symbols in a row to win.
## How to Run
Clone the Tic_Tac_Toe Repo to your local machine. You must intiate a local server using the npx http-server command in the main tic-tac-toe repository. If applicable you may need to download a server package from NPM website. 
## Roadmap of Future Improvements
Would like to update the style and make game board bigger. Also add a restart to the game once a player has won or a draw has occured. Finally I would like to keep a tally of wins and draws for each player.
